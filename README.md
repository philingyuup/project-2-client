# FridgePal Client
Life's too busy to worry about what you have at home. FridgePal will help you keep track of that.

## Introduction
Welcome to the client for my FridgePal project. The project was assigned as our first foray into full stack development. We were assigned a time frame of 4 days to work on this project

## How to get started
You can visit the app [here]https://philingyuup.github.io/project-2-client/ "FridgePal Client"). Client is currently optimized for mobile use.
To get started, please **sign-up** with the **sign-up button**. As a safety precaution, please don't use a *real email* or a *real password*. Be _**creative**_, make a new persona for yourself! Afterwards, just hit the **New List** button and you are on your way!

>>To start using the app, create lists. You can only make items inside of a list

## Planning
My planning for client consisted of separating the workload into their own
sections.

>
> - User API Functionality
> - Item API Functionality
> - List API Functionality
> - Handlebars to display my lists
> - CSS

### Technology
Listed below are the technologies used to complete the client

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Bootstrap
- JQuery

- AJAX
- Handlebars

### User Stories
The main features we wanted to add to our project can best be described by our
user stories for this project.

| As a ... | I want ... |
| -------- | ------------- |
| user   | to keep track of things |
| user   | organize my things |
| user   | 'use' my things and change their quantity |
| user   | my things to belong to me ONLY |

## Progression
I started this client after the backend API. The first steps were to build out the base HTML with a nav. I took a little time to create the fridge icon used for the nav bar I then worked on the client API logic and authorization with the necessary form and buttons. I did some of the styling afterwards and got the nav drop down to work. Afterwards I used handlebar for the table and spent a good amount of time trying to get accordions to work. Finally finished it off by moving buttons and forms around to simplify the functionality of the app.

### Challenges
Throughout this project, I was met with multiple challenges which took me a while to figure out. I had issues with the nav bar and getting it to close and display only one. I used bootstrap's collapsable navbar and did some hardcoding to force the close and display one. The API logic had issues passing on a Bearer token for authorization (syntax error). Handlebar bootstrap-collapsable took a while to implement (hard code).


## Future Features
- Expand functionality
- Ability to share lists and have some permissions
- Desktop version (more powerful?)
- Dark Mode
